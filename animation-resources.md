## Tools
* [WAIT! Animate](http://waitanimate.wstone.io/#!/#%2F): WAIT! Animate provides tools to calculate the keyframe percentages to insert a delay between each animation iteration.

WAIT helps you fit the delay into your keyframes so you get the delayed + repeating beahviour you’re looking for.
